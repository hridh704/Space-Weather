-   **Build:** No build step! Runs directly in the browser with ES Modules and an import map.

## üîë Setup

Before running the application, you need to add your own NASA API key.

1.  **Get a NASA API Key:**
    -   Go to the [NASA API website](https://api.nasa.gov/).
    -   Fill out the form to generate your free API key.

2.  **Add Key to Configuration:**
    -   Open the `config.ts` file in your project.
    -   Replace the placeholder text `"YOUR_NASA_API_KEY_HERE"` with the actual key you received from NASA.
    -   Save the file.

## üöÄ Local Development

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without any build steps.

1.  **Complete the Setup:** Make sure you have added your API key to `config.ts` as described in the Setup section.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cosmic-forecast.git
    cd cosmic-forecast
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since there's no build server, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. For the best experience, it's recommended to serve the directory with a simple local server.

    If you have Python installed:
    ```bash
    # Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üåê Deployment to GitHub Pages

This application is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Create a new repository on GitHub and push your local code to it. **Important:** For security, avoid pushing your `config.ts` file if it contains your real API key.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    -   In your GitHub repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
    -   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    -   Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    -   Under "Branch", select your `main` branch (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/(root)`.
    -   Click **Save**.

3.  **Done!** Your site will be deployed. GitHub will provide you with the URL for your live site (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`). It may take a few minutes for the deployment to complete.
